  WASHINGTON — President Trump loves to set the day’s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best
  told at night.
</p>
<p>
  Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room.
  Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In
  a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump’s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another
  16-hour day planning new lines of attack.
</p>
<p>
  Usually around 6:30 p.m., or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and
  intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by
  himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller.
  When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and
  advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.
</p>
<p>
  During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew
  of no more than a half-dozen empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or
  federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill
  campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders.

  So essentially SNL got it right when it presented Bannon as the Grim Reaper (with Death's big desk to Trump's little
  boy desk).

  “We are moving big and we are moving fast,” Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. “We
  didn’t come here to do small things.”

  But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not
  always guarantee success.
</p>
<p>
  The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of
  other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable first-term president in the
  history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors
  his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said.
</p>
<p>
  This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials,
  congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested
  anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but
  increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash.
</p>
<p>
  “What are we going to do about this?” Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly
  interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch.
</p>
<p>
  Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president’s, said: “I think, in his mind,
  the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody’s going to
  have to bear some responsibility for that.”
</p>
<p>
  “I personally think that they’re missing the big picture here,” Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump’s staff. “Now he’s so
  caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the
  protesters, the media smell blood.”
